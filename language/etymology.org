- The word "spindrift" (meaning spray, particularly from cresting waves in a storm) apparently came from "spoon + drift", where "spoon" is an obsolete Scots dialect word meaning "run into the wind". {Citation and verification needed}
- Both "guest" and "host" derive from a common root word. {Citation and verification needed} (Mentioned on History of English #137, a reference to an earlier episode)
