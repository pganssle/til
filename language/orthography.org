* Punctuation

- The octothorpe / hash / pound / number symbol (#) is derived from a ligature for lb meaning "pound": ℔ (U+2114). The extra line comes from the fact that a previous scribal notation indicated abbreviations with a "tittle" or overbar. Cite:houston2014shady
- The practice of indenting new paragraphs came from printers leaving a large space for hand-written pilcrow characters (¶) and other ornamented marks to be added by a "rubricator"; as the volume of printed documents grew not all the empty space was filled, and the indentation itself eventually took over as the way to mark a new paragraph.
